# depth-estimation
This repository contains a simple implementation of estimating depth using a monocular camera using triangle similarity. It assumes that the dimensions of the object are known. The algorithm also requires an initial depth using a test image to compute the focal length of the lens.This repository contains the following:

* Detecting the depth of a single image(static).
* Live Depth Estimation.
